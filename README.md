# Python toolbox

Small Python toolbox containing various functionalities.

## Introduction
Tired of coding the same chunks of code or copying and pasting existing ones, I've decided 
to share some of my most used functions while refactoring some.

## Tech Stack
The project is written in Python

## Installation
Just the clone repository and use the functions that interest you

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to add or change.

## Notes
As of now, it's just a boilerplate of different things. WORK IN PROGRESS....
